Real-Time Face, Body, Smile, and Eye Detection
This Python script uses OpenCV to perform real-time face, body, smile, and eye detection using pre-trained Haar cascades. It captures video from the default camera (index 0) and displays the detections along with the frame rate (FPS) and the number of faces detected.

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/shreeya1709/https://github.com/shreeya1709


Install the required packages:
pip install opencv-python

Usage
Run the script:
python face_detection.py

Customization
You can customize the detection parameters and cascades used by modifying the script. Check the OpenCV documentation for more information on Haar cascades and detection parameters.

Acknowledgements
This project is based on the tutorials and documentation provided by OpenCV.
Haar cascades used in this project are from the OpenCV GitHub repository.
